# Online Shop Scenario

1. **Customer Browsing and Purchasing:**
   - **Actor:** Customer
   - **Description:** The customer visits the online shop's homepage and uses the search bar to find a specific product. They can also browse categories or view recommended products. When they find a product they like, they click on it to view details such as price, description, and customer reviews. If they decide to purchase, they add the item to their cart. In the cart, they can adjust the quantity, apply any available discounts or coupons, and proceed to checkout. At checkout, they select a shipping method, enter their shipping address, and choose a payment method. After confirming the order, they receive an order confirmation with an estimated delivery date.

2. **Seller Adding Products:**
   - **Actor:** Seller
   - **Description:** The seller logs into their seller account on the online shop's platform. They navigate to the product management section and click on "Add New Product." They fill in details such as the product title, description, category, price, and upload high-quality images. They can also set the quantity available and specify any variations (e.g., sizes or colors). Once all details are filled, they save the product information, making it available for customers to view and purchase.

3. **Admin Managing Sellers:**
   - **Actor:** Admin
   - **Description:** The admin accesses the admin panel of the online shop's platform. They have access to a dashboard showing pending seller registrations and performance metrics of existing sellers. They review pending registrations and approve or reject them based on the provided information. They can also review seller performance metrics, such as sales volume, customer feedback, and adherence to policies. Based on this information, they can take actions such as suspending or terminating seller accounts for policy violations or poor performance.

4. **Customer Account Management:**
   - **Actor:** Customer
   - **Description:** The customer logs into their account on the online shop's platform. They can view and update their personal information, such as name, email address, and shipping address. They can also manage their payment methods, add new ones, or remove existing ones. In the order history section, they can view past orders, check the status of current orders, and track shipments. They can also manage their communication preferences, such as opting in or out of promotional emails.

5. **Seller Fulfilling Orders:**
   - **Actor:** Seller
   - **Description:** The seller receives a notification of a new order on their seller dashboard. They view the order details, including the product(s) ordered, shipping address, and payment information. They then prepare the order for shipment, ensuring that the correct items are packed securely. They generate a shipping label through the platform and affix it to the package. Once the order is shipped, they update the order status on the platform, providing the customer with tracking information if available. They can also communicate with the customer through the platform regarding the order, such as providing updates on shipping status or addressing any concerns the customer may have.
